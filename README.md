- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jack-bryde
- I'm simply using GitHub to store useful VBA & PowerShell scripts, keep losing that damn USB stick!




Other:
- ðŸ‘€ Interested in: health care / pre-hospital medicine / programming / statistics / data science
- Familiarity with a number of languages: C, Python, R, Java. Would like to learn C# or C++ one day.
- "The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." (Cunningham's Law)
- *Note: code has been heavily cut for security reasons and is unlikely to run without additional effort. It is here as a reminder to myself for similar projects in the future.*
