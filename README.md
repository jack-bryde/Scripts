- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jack-bryde
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in: health care economics / pre-hospital medicine / programming / statistics / data science
- I'm simply using GitHub to store useful VBA & PowerShell scripts, but may try some amateur data science projects in the near future.
- Cunningham's Law: "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a question; it's to post the wrong answer." If you are here for whatever reason, please feel free to provide feedback.
- Note code has been heavily cut for security reasons and is unlikely to run without additional effort. It is here as a reminder to myself for similar projects in the future.
