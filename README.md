- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack
- I'm mostly using GitHub to store useful VBA & PowerShell scripts - keep losing that damn USB stick!




Other:
- ðŸ‘€ Interested in: health care / pre-hospital medicine / programming / statistics / data science
- Currently focusing on Power BI
- Familiarity with a number of languages: C, Python, R, Java. Mostly R. 
- I use too many comments, as my coding life is basically [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film))
- *Note: code has been heavily cut for security reasons and is unlikely to run without additional effort. It is here as a reminder to myself for similar projects in the future. Critisism welcome!*
